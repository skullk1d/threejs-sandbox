===============

This is a very simple project used to experiment with WebGL.  
The current master project is an example of a game world with a moveable character.  
The view is 3rd person with an orbiting camera control.  

Controls:
---------

↑ W   
→  D  
↓ S  
← A  
		

Mouse: click and drag to orbit the camera.


*The Minecraft model is from the public [Google Sketchup gallery](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/).  
The WebGL javascript library I'm using is ThreeJS: [https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).  
Most of what I learned came from using the tutorials and examples from [threejs.org](http://threejs.org).*
